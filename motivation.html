          MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) and nanotechnology are highly significant due 
          to their ability to miniaturize, integrate, and enhance the performance of devices and
          systems. These technologies enable the development of smaller, lighter, and more effi-
          cient devices, opening up new possibilities across industries such as electronics, heal-
          thcare, aerospace, and automotive. They offer novel functionalities, exploiting unique 
          properties at the micro and nanoscale. As a TC, we propose papers and publication, orga-
          nize and operate special sessions, tracks, provide volunteers to review papers within our
          scope at IEEE IES flagship conferences.
          <br><br>

          Current research in the area of MEMS and Nanotechnology can be generally listed as follows.
          <ul>
            <li> Sensing and Actuation: MEMS and nanotechnology play a vital role in developing highly
              sensitive and precise sensors for various parameters such as temperature, pressure, acce-
              leration, humidity, and chemical composition. These sensors enable advancements in heal-
              thcare, environmental monitoring, aerospace, and consumer electronics. Actuators based on
              MEMS technology provide controlled mechanical motion for applications like micro-mirrors,
              micro-pumps, micro-valves, and micro-robotics. </li>
            <li> Biomedical Applications: MEMS and nanotechnology have significant applications in the
              biomedical field. This includes lab-on-a-chip devices for diagnostics, implantable devices
              for monitoring and therapy, drug delivery systems, tissue engineering, and biomaterials 
              with enhanced properties. These technologies offer the potential for personalized medicine,
              point-of-care diagnostics, and targeted therapies. </li>
            <li> Microfluidics: MEMS-based microfluidic devices enable precise control and manipulation
              of small volumes of fluids. They find applications in chemical analysis, DNA sequencing, 
              drug discovery, cell sorting, and lab-on-a-chip systems. Microfluidics allows for efficient
              and cost-effective sample processing and analysis, enabling advancements in healthcare, 
              biotechnology, and pharmaceutical industries. </li>
            <li> Energy Harvesting and Storage: MEMS and nanotechnology contribute to energy harvesting 
              and storage systems. Nanomaterials with high surface area and unique properties are used 
              in advanced energy storage devices like batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. MEMS-
              based energy harvesters capture and convert various forms of energy, such as vibration, 
              thermal, and solar energy, into electrical power for self-sustained systems or low-power
              applications. </li>
            <li> Optics and Photonics: MEMS-based optical devices and nanophotonic structures are used 
              in applications such as displays, imaging systems, telecommunications, spectroscopy, and 
              optical switches. MEMS-based micro-mirrors enable precise beam steering, while nanoscale 
              photonic structures enable enhanced light-matter interactions and control of light propa-
              gation at the nanoscale. </li>
            <li> Nanomaterials and Nanofabrication: Research in MEMS and nanotechnology involves the 
              synthesis, characterization, and manipulation of nanomaterials such as nanoparticles, nano-
              tubes, and nanowires. These materials possess unique properties and find applications in 
              various fields, including electronics, catalysis, coatings, sensors, and biomedical devices.
              Nanofabrication techniques, such as lithography, etching, and deposition, enable the manu-
              facturing of nanoscale structures and devices. </li>
            <li> Environmental and Sustainability Applications: MEMS and nanotechnology can contribute to
              environmental monitoring, pollution detection, water purification, and energy efficiency. 
              Nanomaterial-based sensors can detect pollutants and toxic gases, while MEMS-based devices
              can enable precise control and monitoring of environmental parameters. Nanomaterials are also
              explored for sustainable energy generation and resource utilization. </li>
